      Welcome to your 2020 calendar of flavor!
  </p>
  <p>
      This box is an advent calendar: there are 25 numbered plastic bags, one for each day. They are grouped inside paper bags.
  </p>
  <p>
      Every day you will open one of the plastic bags and examine the contents with all of your senses. I recommend opening bags with your eyes shut and giving a (gentle) sniff before you look or taste.
  </p>
  <p>
      Once you have tasted the day's ingredient and think you know what it is, head over to the <a href='/index.html'>calendar page</a> and click on the number for the bag you just opened.
  </p>
  <p>
      The ingredients go together to make four tasty wintertime treats. You'll get a link to a recipe with the last ingredient in each set.
  </p>
  <p>
      To make it easier for you to select bags with your eyes closed, I've grouped them inside paper bags. Within each paper bag, the order that you taste the ingredients doesn't matter.
  </p>
  <p>
      For example, the first recipe uses ingredients 1 through 4. There is a paper bag with ingredients 1, 2, and 3, and another paper bag with ingredient 4.
  </p>

  <p>
      Happy tasting!
  </p>
